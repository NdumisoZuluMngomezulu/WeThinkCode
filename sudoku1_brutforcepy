            Hi There dummy🙋🏾👋🏾.
            I hear you can't solve a simple sudoku puzzle
            I will teach you how to solve sudoku as i solve it
            This is the brute force method
            I will simply search from the first index [0][0] to the last [8][8]
            When i find an empty space i will generate a random number
            I will then check if the number does not already exist in the row and column
            While also checking if it does not already exist in it's 3x3 sub-grid
            All this will be done by calling the 'check_play' method to validate if it's a valid choice
            This will be repeated until the puzzle is solved

        I set a variable called playable to the boolean value False\n       I'll now enter a while with playable as the condition
        Once i find a suitable choice for the position i am in using the function check_play, i will add it to the board""")
